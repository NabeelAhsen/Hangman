# Hangman
A simple hangman game written in Python3! 

If you have Python3 installed and is part of your path, you can run this program from your commandline:
```
$ python3 Hangman.py
```
This is one of my first side projects. The goal for this project is to create a playable hangman game with randomized word selection.

## Goals

1. Create a functional hangman game written in Python where a user is prompted for letters or is able to guess the word.

2. Randomize word selection given a text file of words. The length of each word should be bounded by the number of limbs the hangman has.

## Still to do

1. The categories provided aren't conclusive. A user's input is case sensitive.
